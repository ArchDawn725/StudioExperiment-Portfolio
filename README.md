# StudioExperiment-Portfolio

**StudioExperiment-Portfolio (2024)**

Two Prototypes • Studio Leadership Test • Architecture & Team Management Portfolio

This repository contains two prototypes developed under a self-funded experimental studio initiative in 2024. The goal of this experiment was to determine whether a micro-budget studio with entry-level contributors could produce high-quality, market-ready mobile/PC games under my leadership as lead programmer, systems architect, and project director.

Both prototypes—Line Wars and Dispatch Disaster (2024)—represent significant improvements in my architectural discipline, coding clarity, and ability to lead a small team toward a shared technical vision.

**⭐ Project Purpose**

This studio experiment was designed to evaluate:

My ability to lead a small multidisciplinary team

Whether inexperienced contributors could be trained or guided to production quality

My capability to establish and enforce coding standards

How well a team functions under clear goals, limited budgets, and tight structure

The feasibility of building mobile-ready systems using efficient architecture

Whether lightweight prototypes could realistically scale into commercially viable games

Both projects reached a playable state and demonstrated strong internal system design, even if art and contributor output varied significantly.

**🧩 Included Prototypes**
*1. Line Wars (Mobile Strategy Prototype)*

A single-player mobile tug-of-war strategy game featuring:

Three-lane combat

Upgrade & research systems

Custom pathfinding

Modular unit/building architecture

Highly optimized tick-based simulation (60 FPS target)

Development Team:

Me — Lead Programmer, Architect, Technical Direction

Game Designer

2D Artist

Sound Designer

3 Testers

Project Outcome:

Playable prototype published on itch.io

Cancelled due to lack of contributor participation

Cleanest architectural codebase of the two prototypes

*2. Dispatch Disaster (2024 Reimagining)*

A modern rebuild of my 2020 emergency-management simulation including:

Procedural map generation

Custom A* pathfinding

Asymmetric agencies with different mechanics

Upgrade systems

Public-confidence win/lose conditions

Fully playable on itch.io

Development Team:

Me — Lead Programmer, Systems Designer

3D Artist (partial contribution before withdrawal)

Project Outcome:

Fully playable and showcased at events

Cancelled due to art delays and budget overrun

Strong emphasis on readability & maintainable code

**🏗️ Architecture & Code Quality Improvements**

Across both prototypes, I standardized and enforced a modern coding structure:

*✔ Single-Responsibility Scripts*

Every script handles one job only, resulting in predictable flow and easy testing.

*✔ Centralized String Catalog*

Prevents typos, improves refactoring, and reduces dependency confusion.

*✔ Consistent Naming Conventions*

Readable for entry-level collaborators and testers.

*✔ Organized Folder Hierarchy*

*✔ Minimal Use of Update()*

Gameplay controlled by:

Tick systems

Coroutines

Event-driven logic

This resulted in mobile-friendly, low-CPU architectures.

*✔ Custom Editor Tools*

Allow designers to:

Build maps

Configure nodes

Adjust pathfinding
without needing to enter Play Mode.

*✔ Scalable, Team-Friendly Systems*

Code was written so new contributors could onboard quickly, even without strong programming backgrounds.

**🧪 Leadership & Production Experience**

These prototypes demonstrate my ability to:

Lead a small multidisciplinary team

Communicate workflows across programming, art, sound, and design

Maintain morale while enforcing accountability

Make difficult decisions (including project cancellation)

Allocate micro-budgets effectively

Mentor inexperienced contributors

Build prototypes with clear technical direction and achievable scope

Produce readable, maintainable, scalable code others could use

Keep progress moving in the face of setbacks

The most important outcome of this experiment was proving that I could run a small team effectively, while maintaining a high bar for engineering quality.

**🎯 Why These Projects Matter**

Even though both prototypes were cancelled before reaching full production, this repo showcases:

My growth as a technical leader

My ability to architect clean, modular codebases

How I manage micro-teams with limited resources

My commitment to readable, scalable engineering practices

How I adapt older projects into modern, well-structured versions

Real-world experience in making tough project decisions

A level of coding discipline suitable for mid/senior-level Unity roles

These prototypes represent a turning point in my development career—where I shifted from “solo developer building large projects” to a leader capable of driving a team toward production-quality results.
